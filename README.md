# 100 Days of LeetCode Challenge üöÄ

Welcome to my **100 Days of LeetCode Challenge** repository! This is where I document my journey of solving at least one LeetCode problem every day for 100 consecutive days.
The goal is to improve my problem-solving skills, master data structures and algorithms,and prepare for technical interviews.

## üìå Overview
- **Duration**: 100 days
- **Daily Goal**: Solve at least 1 LeetCode problem (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- **Focus**: Data Structures, Algorithms, Time & Space Complexity Optimization
- **Progress Tracking**: Daily updates with problem links, solutions, and reflections.

## üîç What's Included for Each Day
- **Problem Link**: LeetCode problem URL.
- **Approach**: Brief explanation of the solution logic.
- **Solution Code**: Implemented in Python/Java/C++ (or others).
- **Time & Space Complexity**: Analysis of the solution.
- **Key Takeaways**: Lessons learned or optimizations discovered.

## üèÜ Goals
- [ ] Solve **100+ LeetCode problems** across all difficulty levels.
- [ ] Master **core data structures** (Arrays, Trees, Graphs, etc.).
- [ ] Improve **algorithmic thinking** (DP, BFS/DFS, Sliding Window, etc.).
- [ ] Track **progress** and identify weak areas for improvement.

## üìä Progress Tracker
